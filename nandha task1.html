   <center> <h1> THENI( NANDHA) DISTRICT</h1>
    <p> <b> <i>THENI </i></b>is a hidden paradise in the state of Tamil Nadu.</p>
</center>
    <hr>
    <p>Theni is a  District in Tamil Nadu, it will be a good experience to those who love the remote villages and who
         wants to live close to nature. Stay at Theni and leave for Meghamalai early in the morning, 
        that is  the best time to visit the destination.Theni highways are beautiful and really wide. We enjoyed our ride to the best. <br>
        Meghamalai is located 50km away fro Theni, and when we visited there was no proper road towards the destination.
         But now there are well paved roads upto the Meghamalai top, and the adventure is not there.
         As you uphill, the view awaits you is something really stunning and you will be never disappointed with the effort.</p>
